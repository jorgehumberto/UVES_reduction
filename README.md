# UVES_reduction

The scripts in this repository will allow you to perform a full reduction of the data obtained with the UVES spectrograph from the VLT telescope at the LaSilla-Paranal Observatory from the European Southern Observatory (ESO). At this moment, you can find two different tools:

1) uves_reduce_data.py
This tool will perform the reduction of the raw observations

2) uves_ccf_create.py
This tool will compute the Cross-Correlation Function of the reduced observations

Please refer to MANUAL.pdf for detailed instructions on how to use these tools.
